## Explanations of the technologies used

React.js is used for frontend development with Redux for state management and Material UI for styling. Axios is used to fetch REST APIs from the backend Express.js server with MongoDB as the database. JWT authentication is also incorporated.

## A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took

Firstly, I did the initial setup of the frontend and the backend and the setup of the database. Next, I integrated redux for state management and tested the app by seeding some posts. After that, authentication (login/logout) for the app is set up.

Then, I worked on the details page of a post. Following that, I added the comments feature to the details page. Finally, I introduced the posts by artist.
